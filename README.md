Encounter - HackMIT Android Application Project
================================================

Encounter is a mobile application that makes it easy to find other people for short engagements. Through temporary virtual rooms in which users can see the GPS locations of others and the shortest path to finding them, Enconter provides a solution to meeting up with others that is much more private than existing apps such as FindMyFriends.
